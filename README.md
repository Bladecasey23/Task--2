# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the solution to **Task 2** of the AI & ML Internship program â€” focusing on statistical exploration and visualization of data.

## Objective
To understand data through summary statistics and visualizations using EDA techniques.

## Dataset Used
[Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Key Concepts Covered
- Summary Statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Histograms and Boxplots
- Countplots and Pairplots
- Correlation Matrix
- Interactive Visualization with Plotly

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Insights from EDA
- Most passengers are in the 20-40 age range.
- Survival rate was higher for females than males.
- Higher passenger class (1st) correlates with better survival chances.
- Fare and Age have some relationship with survival status.
